# Curve Fitting: Implemented by a Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains a solution to the Curve Fitting Problem that is finding a close polynomial representation like $p(x)$ for a given sample of points like $(x_i, y_i)$ so that in the perfect scenario, $p(x_i)=y_i$ for all $i\in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$.  
At its core, this program had an educational purpose as it was one of my first computer assignment in the course Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran.
